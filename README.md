Termapp is a python package to write console based interfaces.
It is based on python's urwid package to render into the console several kind of widgets.

Termapp creates the skeleton of a console based application, letting the user to quickly have a ircII-like environment, with a command prompt, titlebar, text flows, different pages and chapters, asynchronous execution of commands, text completion, and much more.

I use termapp whenever I have a console based application that must receive commands on a prompt, and must display something.
